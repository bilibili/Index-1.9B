Please provide a clear and step-by-step solution for a scientific problem in the categories of Chemistry, Physics, or Mathematics. The problem will specify the unit of measurement, which should not be included in the answer. Express the final answer as a decimal number with three digits after the decimal point. Conclude the answer by stating 'Therefore, the answer is \boxed[ANSWER].

Promblem 1: The wave function $\Psi_2(1,2)$ given by Equation 9.39 is not normalized as it stands. Determine the normalization constant of $\Psi_2(1,2)$ given that the "1s" parts are normalized.
Answer: The answer is \boxed{0.70710678}.
