Being able to eat breakfast by the pool is seen as a plus.\nThe hotel is clean and well-maintained overall. Rooms may be small but are comfortable and adequately equipped.\nThe location is convenient, though about 2 miles from the main attractions in Key West. Free parking and trolley stops onsite make up for this. \nThe value is considered good for the price, especially compared to hotels closer to downtown.\n\nCons:\nRooms, especially standard rooms, tend to be very small and lack amenities like mini fridges. Suites offer more space.\nNoise from the highway and thin walls between rooms can disturb sleep. The air conditioners also tend to be loud.\nThe location means a taxi or bike/scooter ride is required to get to main attractions. Walking takes about 40 minutes.\nSome complain the hotel overall feels a bit dated and run-down, though clean.\nSo in summary, while the Fairfield Inn has some issues common to budget hotels, the main strengths appear to be the friendly, knowledgeable staff, beautiful pool area, decent value for the price, and clean, comfortable rooms.

We apply MMA to the simultaneous machine translation task and demonstrate better latency-quality tradeoffs compared to MILk, the previous state-of-the-art approach.

To address this issue, we design a reinforcement learning framework to search for efficient DenseNet architectures with layer-wise pruning (LWP) for different tasks, while retaining the original advantages of DenseNet, such as feature reuse, short paths, etc. In this framework, an agent evaluates the importance of each connection between any two block layers, and prunes the redundant connections.

The Category 3 storm is expected to hit the Southeast sometime tomorrow, and hundreds of thousands of residents have been ordered out of their homes in three North Carolina counties. Norfolk, Va., is also ordering residents to evacuate, and Washington, DC, has been forced to postpone Sunday's planned MLK Memorial dedication. \"This is a very, very serious situation,\" a spokeswoman for Dare County told ABC News. \"We have not seen anything like this in the lifetimes of most our residents. Once the storm hits, it will be very difficult to respond to distress calls.\" Irene is some 700 miles wide now and moving at a slow 12mph, which means it can wreak extensive damage in a region over a long period of time; it could cause up to $13.9 billion in damage on the East Coast. The storm is expected to barrel into New York City on Sunday, packing winds of up to 90mph. New Jersey communities are already being evacuated, and hundreds of street fairs have been canceled and elder care facilities and hospitals in low-lying area will be evacuated in New York today.
